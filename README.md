## About This Fork

This is a maintained fork of **Captura**, the excellent screen recording tool originally created by **Mathew Sachin** and later maintained by **Mr. Chip (mrchipset)**. This fork aims to keep the software working smoothly with modern systems while preserving its core philosophy: **small, portable, and just works**.

### Recent Updates (v10.3.0)

With the help of **Cursor** and **Claude**, significant improvements have been made:

**Classic UI Fixes:**
- ✅ Fixed all data binding errors for proper MVVM architecture
- ✅ Restored video source and webcam preview windows
- ✅ Fixed region selector live coordinate updates
- ✅ Implemented refresh button shake animations for visual feedback
- ✅ Fixed audio/webcam source listing and selection
- ✅ Removed deprecated features and cleaned up UI
- ✅ Fixed drawing tools toggle and region selection workflow

**Modern UI & Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Fixed the FFmpeg download window initialization issue
- ✅ Updated FFmpeg download mirrors to ensure reliability
- ✅ Improved build and release workflows
- ✅ Dual UI build system (Classic and Modern)

### UI Versions

**Classic UI** - The traditional, compact interface loved by long-time users. Fully restored and working with all features including separate preview windows and the classic layout.

**Modern UI** - A refreshed interface with in-window preview and updated styling for users who prefer a more contemporary look.

Both versions share the same powerful capture engine and feature set. Choose the one that fits your workflow!
