# GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository uses streamlined GitHub Actions workflows to minimize server load and provide clear control over when builds run.

## üì¶ Production Release Workflow

### `dual-release.yml`
**Trigger:** Automatic when you push a version tag (e.g., `v10.3.0`)

**What it does:**
- Builds **both** Modern UI (from `main` branch) and Classic UI (from `classic-ui-modern-fixes` branch)
- Creates 4 downloadable files:
  - `nCaptura-vX.X.X-Setup.exe` (Modern UI installer)
  - `nCaptura-vX.X.X-Portable.zip` (Modern UI portable)
  - `Captura-vX.X.X-Classic-Setup.exe` (Classic UI installer)
  - `Captura-vX.X.X-Classic-Portable.zip` (Classic UI portable)
- Publishes a GitHub Release with all 4 files

**When to use:**
```bash
# After updating version numbers on both branches
git checkout main
git tag v10.3.0
git push origin v10.3.0
```

## üêõ Debug Build Workflow

### `debug-builds.yml`
**Trigger:** Manual only (workflow_dispatch)

**What it does:**
- Builds Debug version of Modern UI, Classic UI, or both
- Uploads artifacts (available for 7 days)
- No release created, no installers built

**When to use:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab on GitHub
2. Click **Debug Builds** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Choose which UI to build:
   - `modern` - Build only Modern UI
   - `classic` - Build only Classic UI  
   - `both` - Build both UIs
5. Click **Run workflow**

**Perfect for:**
- Testing bug fixes before release
- Verifying builds without creating releases
- Quick iteration during development

## üéØ Workflow Design Principles

### Minimal Server Load
- **No automatic builds on push** - Prevents hundreds of workflow runs
- **No automatic builds on PR** - Only build when you explicitly need to test
- **Manual debug builds** - Full control over when to test
- **Release only on tags** - Production releases are intentional

### Clear Separation
- **Production** - Only `dual-release.yml` runs automatically (on tags)
- **Development** - `debug-builds.yml` runs manually when you need it
- **No redundancy** - Each workflow has a single, clear purpose

## üìä Comparison with Old Setup

| Old Workflows | New Workflows |
|---------------|---------------|
| 4 workflow files | 2 workflow files |
| Runs on every push | Runs only on tags |
| Runs on every PR | Manual only for testing |
| 2-3 builds per tag | 1 unified dual build |
| Hard to control | Full control |

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Regular Development
```bash
# Make changes
git commit -m "Fix bug"
git push

# ‚úÖ No workflows run - no server load
```

### Example 2: Test Before Release
1. Push your changes
2. Go to Actions ‚Üí Debug Builds ‚Üí Run workflow
3. Select "both" to test both UIs
4. Download artifacts and test locally
5. If good, create release tag

### Example 3: Create Release
```bash
# Update versions on both branches
git checkout main
# Edit version to 10.3.1
git commit -m "Bump to 10.3.1"
git push

git checkout classic-ui-modern-fixes  
# Edit version to 10.3.1
git commit -m "Bump to 10.3.1"
git push

# Create release
git checkout main
git tag v10.3.1
git push origin v10.3.1

# ‚úÖ dual-release.yml runs automatically
# ‚úÖ Creates release with 4 files
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

### If You Need to Modify Workflows

**For debug builds:**
Edit `.github/workflows/debug-builds.yml`

**For releases:**
Edit `.github/workflows/dual-release.yml`

**Testing workflow changes:**
Use `debug-builds.yml` to test - it won't create releases even if it fails.

## üìù Notes

- Debug artifacts are kept for **7 days** only
- Releases are permanent
- All builds use **windows-2022** runner
- Debug builds use **Debug** configuration
- Release builds use **Release** configuration
