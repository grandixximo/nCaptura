# Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Drawing Tools Checkbox Fix
**Problem**: The "Drawing Tools" checkbox in HomePage was not hiding/showing the drawing tools toolbar in RegionSelector.

**Root Cause**: Binding path mismatch. The RegionSelector elements were trying to bind to `Settings.UI.RegionSelectorDrawingTools` without proper context, while the checkbox in HomePage was binding to the same property through MainViewModel's DataContext.

**Solution**:
- Updated `RegionSelector.xaml` to use the full binding path: `{Binding MainViewModel.Settings.UI.RegionSelectorDrawingTools, Source={StaticResource ServiceLocator}}`
- This ensures consistent binding across both the InkCanvas (line 104) and the drawing tools Border (line 327)
- Restored the code-behind DataContext assignment for MainControls (as the comment indicates setting it in XAML causes crashes)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/Captura/Windows/RegionSelector.xaml` - Fixed binding paths for drawing tools visibility
- `src/Captura/Windows/RegionSelector.xaml.cs` - Restored MainControls DataContext assignment

### 2. Record Button Icons Fix
**Problem**: Record button icons appear blank/not displaying.

**Root Cause Investigation**: Added comprehensive debugging to `StateToRecordButtonGeometryConverter` to identify why icons aren't displaying.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the converter with error handling and debug logging
- The converter now:
  - Checks if IIconSet is properly registered
  - Validates the icon strings before parsing
  - Logs detailed debug information about the conversion process
  - Handles exceptions gracefully

**Files Modified**:
- `src/Captura/ValueConverters/StateToRecordButtonGeometryConverter.cs` - Added debugging and error handling

## Testing Instructions

### For Drawing Tools:
1. Start Captura
2. Select a Region video source
3. Check the "Drawing Tools" checkbox on the HomePage
4. The RegionSelector window should appear with the drawing tools toolbar visible on the right side
5. Uncheck the "Drawing Tools" checkbox
6. The drawing tools toolbar should disappear from the RegionSelector window

### For Record Button Icons:
1. Start Captura and check the Windows Debug Output (DebugView or Visual Studio Output window)
2. Look for debug messages from `[StateToRecordButtonGeometryConverter]`
3. The record button should show:
   - A circle icon when not recording (Record icon)
   - A square icon when recording (Stop icon)
4. Check these locations:
   - Main window header (top toolbar when expanded)
   - Main window Expander header (collapsed view)
   - RegionSelector window bottom toolbar

### Debug Output to Check:
If the record button is still blank, look for these debug messages:
- `[StateToRecordButtonGeometryConverter] IIconSet is null!` - means the icon service isn't registered
- `[StateToRecordButtonGeometryConverter] Icon string is null or empty!` - means the MaterialDesignIcons aren't providing data
- `[StateToRecordButtonGeometryConverter] Value is not RecorderState: <type>` - means the binding is passing the wrong type
- `[StateToRecordButtonGeometryConverter] Exception: <message>` - means the geometry parsing failed

## Build Verification
- Successfully built `Captura.Core.csproj` with 0 errors
- Full WPF build requires Windows with `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop` SDK

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

If the drawing tools still don't hide/show:
- Check if `VisualSettings.RegionSelectorDrawingTools` is being persisted correctly
- Verify the BoolToVisibilityConverter is registered in App.xaml

If the record button icons are still blank:
- Review the debug output messages
- Check if MaterialDesignIcons is registered as IIconSet in the ServiceProvider
- Verify the RecorderState.Value is being updated properly
