Fix: Resolve build errors in DirectShow webcam implementation

- Fix BindToMoniker call signature in CaptureWebcam.cs
- Refactor Filter enumeration to avoid yield return in try-catch
- Build now succeeds on .NET SDK 8.0 (net472 target)
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/Captura.Windows/Webcam/CaptureWebcam.cs` (fixed Marshal.BindToMoniker usage)
- `src/Captura.Windows/Webcam/Filter.cs` (refactored to avoid yield in try-catch)

## Build Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: BindToMoniker Signature âœ…
**Error:**
```
error CS1501: No overload for method 'BindToMoniker' takes 2 arguments
error CS0019: Operator '<' cannot be applied to operands of type 'object' and 'int'
```

**Fix:**
Changed from:
```csharp
var hr = Marshal.BindToMoniker(_videoDevice.MonikerString, out source);
if (hr < 0 || source == null)
```

To:
```csharp
try
{
    source = Marshal.BindToMoniker(_videoDevice.MonikerString);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException($"Cannot bind to device: {_videoDevice.Name}", ex);
}
```

### Issue 2: Yield Return in Try-Catch âœ…
**Error:**
```
error CS1626: Cannot yield a value in the body of a try block with a catch clause
```

**Fix:**
Refactored to collect filters in a List first, then yield after the try-catch:
```csharp
var filters = new List<Filter>();
// ... collect in try-catch ...
foreach (var filter in filters)
{
    yield return filter;
}
```
